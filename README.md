# rhtmlTemplate

An R HTMLWidget project template.

# Installation in R

1. `library(devtools)`
1. `install_github('Displayr/rhtmlTemplate')`

Simplest Example to verify installation:

```
rhtmlTemplate::template()
```


# Local Installation to Develop/Contribute

**Prerequisites** - For help installing prerequisites see the `Prequisite Installation Help` section below

1. nodejs >= 6.9.5
1. yarn > 0.21 (install via npm install -g yarn)
1. python 2.7 - one of the nodejs libraries needs python during the installation process
1. (optional) r >= 3.0.0 - you can develop without R, but cannot produce r docs or test in r 

## Installing the rhtmlTemplate code

1. Change directory to the place where you put git projects
1. type `git clone git@github.com:Displayr/rhtmlTemplate.git` ENTER
1. type `cd rhtmlTemplate` ENTER
1. type `yarn install` ENTER
    1. `yarn install` is noisy and will print several warnings about `UNMET` and `DEPRECATED`. Ignore these and only make note of errors. If it fails, try running it again.
1. type `gulp serve` ENTER
    1. If `gulp serve` does not work try `./node_modules/.bin/gulp serve`. To correct this and to make your nodejs life easier you should add `./node_modules/.bin` to your PATH. Consult the Internet for instructions on how to do so on your OS of choice.

If this worked, then the `gulp serve` command opened your browser and you are looking at `http://localhost:9000`. You should see a page listing a bunch of links to examples, each example shows the simple 4 square widget template. These examples are defined in the [internal www content directory](theSrc/internal_www/content).

    ```
1. Now start r by running the R `r` command, and in the R terminal run these commands:
    ```
        install.packages("devtools")
        install.packages("roxygen2")
    ```

# Developing and Contributing

rhtmlTemplate relies heavily on [rhtmlBuildUtils](https://github.com/Displayr/rhtmlBuildUtils). You should read through the docs in the rhtmlBuildUtils repo to understand:
 
 1. which gulp tasks are available
 1. the constraints on file layout in your widget project
 1. How to perform visual testing.
 
 Here are a few important notes (both detailed in the rhtmlBuildUtils docs) you must keep in mind:

1. The last thing you do before committing is run `gulp build` to ensure all the autogenerated files are up to date.
2. (With some exceptions) ONLY EDIT THINGS IN these directories: `theSrc`, `bdd`, `docs`, and sometimes `build` !! Many of the other files are auto generated based on the contents of `theSrc`. As an example, if you edit `R/rhtmlTemplate.R` and then run `gulp build` your changes will be DELETED FOREVER!, because `R/rhtmlTemplate.R` is just a copy of `theSrc/R/htmlwidget.R`. See [htmlwidget_build_system](docs/htmlwidget_build_system.md) for more details.

## Contributing to rhtmlTemplate
1. Do not work in master, as the master branch of rhtmlTemplate is used to verify the R server build process.
1. Create a branch, make some changes, add test for your changes, update the docs if necessary, push your branch, and create a pull request on github.

## How the git prepush hook works (aka: My git push got rejected ?!)

This project uses the npm [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) module to add git lifecycle hooks to the project. These are defined in the `scripts` section of the [package.json](./package.json) file.
 
Of particular interest is the `prepush` entry which runs a script that checks the project code style using the `gulp lint` command. If there are errors, then it will reject your git push command. You have two options:
  
1. Fix the errors and try pushing again. To see which errors are in the code run `gulp lint`. To autofix as many as possible run `gulp lint --fix`; this will only report the errors it could not auto-fix. Don't forget to commit your code again before pushing.
1. If you must (not recommended) add a --no-verify (i.e., `git push origin head --no-verify`) to skip the style checking.

Here is an illustrative sequence:

```bash
Kyles-MBP:rhtmlTemplate kyle$ git push origin head

> husky - npm run -s prepush

...

/Users/kyle/projects/numbers/rhtmlTemplate/bdd/steps/loadThePage.steps.js

...

Kyles-MBP:rhtmlTemplate kyle$ git push origin head
```
