# rhtmlMoonPlot

An opinionated template for the creation of html widget repositories using ES6

## Installation

To install from GitHub:
```
require(devtools)
install_github("Displayr/rhtmlMoonPlot", dependencies = NA)
```

If you have not set up a GitHub Personal Access Token, you will likely need to do so to avoid 
GitHub rate limits, which will manifest as 403 errors when downloading packages via
`install_github`. Please see the documentation in the `usethis` package or see the 
instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

If you are using Windows, you will need to have a version of Rtools installed that matches your
version of R in order to build packages from source. Rtools can be downloaded from
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

Specifying `dependencies = NA` in `install_github` will not install packages listed
in `Suggests` in the `DESCRIPTION` file (some of which may be proprietary and unavailable for download).

## Updating visual test baselines

The `JS tests` workflow runs automatically on every push. Its `Visual regression tests` job compares
rendered output against the committed baselines in `theSrc/test/snapshots/ci/master` (CI always
compares against `master`'s baselines, whatever branch it is running on). Any intended change to
rendering, layout or label placement will turn the job red and the baselines have to be regenerated.
A missing baseline also fails, rather than being silently accepted.

Baselines are environment specific — locally generated snapshots (`npm run localTest`, which writes
to `theSrc/test/snapshots/local/<branch>`) will not match CI's fonts and Chromium build, so do not
copy them into `theSrc/test/snapshots/ci`. Regenerate through CI instead:

1. **Inspect the failure first.** Download the `snapshot-diffs` artifact from the failed run and check
   the `__diff_output__` images. Only regenerate once you are satisfied every diff is intended.
2. **Dispatch a regeneration run.** Actions → `JS tests` → *Run workflow*, select your branch, and
   tick `update_snapshots`. Optionally set `test_filter` (passed to `jest -t`) to regenerate only the
   tests matching a name pattern; leave it blank to regenerate all of them.
3. **Download the `regenerated-baselines` artifact** from that run. Its contents are rooted at
   `master/`, so extract it into `theSrc/test/snapshots/ci/` — not over the repository root.
4. **Review, commit and push the changed snapshots yourself.** Use `git status` / `git diff --stat` to
   confirm only the snapshots you expected have changed.

Steps 2 and 3 can be done from the command line with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
instead of the Actions UI:

```sh
# Dispatch a regeneration run on the current branch (add -f test_filter=<pattern> to narrow it)
gh workflow run "JS tests" --ref "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)" -f update_snapshots=true

# Get the run id, then follow it to completion
gh run list --workflow "JS tests" --event workflow_dispatch --limit 1
gh run watch <run-id>

# Extract the baselines straight into place -- the artifact is rooted at master/
gh run download <run-id> -n regenerated-baselines -D theSrc/test/snapshots/ci

# And the diffs from a failed comparison run, if you want them on disk
gh run download <run-id> -n snapshot-diffs -D .tmp/diffs
```

CI deliberately does not commit the baselines for you. A push made with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`
does not trigger any workflow, and `workflow_dispatch` check runs are excluded from a pull request's
status rollup — so a bot-authored head commit would leave the PR reporting no checks. Pushing the
snapshots yourself produces the full set of checks on the PR.

## Submitting a bug report

If you encounter a problem using the package, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Displayr/rhtmlMoonPlot/issues). To achieve a resolution as quickly as possible, please include a minimal, reproducible example of the bug, along with the exact error message or output you receive and the behavior you expect. Including the output of `sessionInfo()` in R can be helpful to reproduce the issue. Please see this [FAQ](https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-whats-a-reproducible-example-reprex-and-how-do-i-create-one/5219), which has a number of useful tips on creating great reproducible examples.
